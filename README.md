## Titan
The TITAN is an appointment booking system which is intended for hosts and users. Hosts are people who offer services, and consultations. While users are the people who will avail the services of the host by applying through appointments. The user is required to register for an account, before logging in to see available events that they are able to schedule an appointment for. The user can browse, filter, sort, and search a variety of events (such as haircuts, consultations, and many more). The appointees will be notified by the app that they have an appointment 3 times. The first is at 00:00 on the day of the appointment, the second is 5 minutes before the scheduled appointment and the third is at the time of the appointment. The user can cancel their appointments and the hosts can cancel their events if they intend to.
